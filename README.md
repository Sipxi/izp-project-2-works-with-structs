# 📐 Project: FigSearch - Shape Detection in Bitmap 🖼️

# ✔️ Mark: 12.5/14:00 (-1.5 was only because of my own inattention, explained down below)

## 🚀 Project Description

The goal of this project is to create a program that detects the **longest horizontal and vertical lines** 🔴, and the **largest squares** 🔳, in a given **monochromatic image**. The image is stored as a **bitmap** in a text file in the form of a **rectangular matrix** of zeros and ones. The program should print the starting and ending coordinates of the detected line or square.

## 💻 Implementation

Implement the program in the source file **figsearch.c**. Submit the source file through the information system.

### 🔧 Compilation and Submission

To compile and test the program, use the following command:

```bash
$ cc -std=c11 -Wall -Wextra -Werror figsearch.c -o figsearch
```
